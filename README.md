# MachineLearning-Supervised
Supervised machine learning grouped into classification and regression problems.
All data is labeled and the algorithms learn to predict the output from the input data. 
The goal is to predict output variables from the input data. 

Supervised machine learning grouped into classification and regression problems.

Classification: When output variable is category 
Regression: when output variable is continouns real value

RandomForest, XGBoost for classification and regression
Linear regression for regression problems
Support vector machines for classification problems
